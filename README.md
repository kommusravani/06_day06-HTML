HTML allows us to divide a web page or a  simple browser window into several peices or panes called Frames <br>
Each frame can contain a seperate HTML document. <br>
so Frames allow us to display more than HTML document in the same browser window simultaneously <br>
Each frame is independent of others  <BR>
A collection of frames in the browser windw is known as a frameset <br>
